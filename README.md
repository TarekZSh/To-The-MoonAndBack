My teammates and I collaborated on this project, presenting it as our solution for the "To The Moon And Back" hackathon.✨

It is An application that will make the location 📍 of the spacecraft "Beresheet 2" accessible in real-time to the general audience
so that the application will include visualization of the route , live data 📈, and progress⏳ in the mission stages of the spacecraft. 
And in order to do this, we relied on the information from the previous spacecraft, "Beresheet 1" 

Ad Luna! 🚀🌖
